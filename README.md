# etch-a-sketch
## A simple etch-a-sketch page

#### This is a simple etch-a-sketch that is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a project from The Odin Project's curriculum. The project can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav

#### The project is a simple etch-a-sketch that allows the user click on a square and change the color of the square. The user can also change the number of squares on the grid.

#### The project was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS were used to create the grid and the JavaScript was used to add the functionality to the grid.

#### The project was made by me, but I did use some code from The Odin Project's curriculum to help me with the project. The code can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project?ref=lnav
